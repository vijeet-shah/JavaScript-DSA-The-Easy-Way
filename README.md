# JavaScript-DSA-The-Easy-Way
This repo is a comprehensive guide to learning data structures and algorithms in JavaScript. It covers a wide range of topics, including arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, sorting algorithms, and searching algorithms. 


# Arrays are one of the most basic data structures in JavaScript. They are used to store a collection of elements of the same type.

# Linked lists are another basic data structure in JavaScript. They are a sequence of nodes, each of which contains a value and a pointer to the next node in the list.

# Stacks are a data structure that follows the last-in, first-out (LIFO) principle. This means that the last element added to the stack is the first element to be removed.

# Queues are a data structure that follows the first-in, first-out (FIFO) principle. This means that the first element added to the queue is the first element to be removed.

# Trees are a more complex data structure than arrays, linked lists, stacks, or queues. They are a hierarchical data structure, in which each node can have one or more children.

# Graphs are a data structure that represents a set of objects and the relationships between them.

# Sorting algorithms are algorithms that are used to sort a collection of elements.

# Searching algorithms are algorithms that are used to find an element in a collection of elements.
