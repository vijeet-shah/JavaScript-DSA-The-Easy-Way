**Practice and Challenges:**

1. Implement various insertion and deletion methods.
2. Reverse a linked list.
3. Detect and remove cycles in a linked list.
4. Implement doubly linked list operations.
5. Implement circular linked list operations.
6. Solve problems related to linked lists on coding platforms.

**Easy:**

1. Implement a basic singly linked list and append elements to it.
2. Display the elements of a linked list.
3. Insert an element at the beginning of a linked list.
4. Insert an element at the end of a linked list.
5. Delete the first element from a linked list.
6. Delete the last element from a linked list.
7. Search for an element in a linked list.
8. Reverse a singly linked list.

**Intermediate:**

1. Implement a doubly linked list and perform basic operations.
2. Detect if a linked list has a cycle.
3. Find the middle element of a linked list in one pass.
4. Remove duplicates from a sorted linked list.
5. Merge two sorted linked lists into a single sorted list.
6. Swap nodes in a linked list without swapping data.
7. Rotate a linked list by a given number of positions.

**Advanced:**

1. Clone a linked list with next and random pointers.
2. Sort a linked list using merge sort or quicksort.
3. Check if a linked list is a palindrome.
4. Implement skip list operations (insertion, deletion, search).
5. Implement skip list search in O(log n) time.
6. Implement a circular linked list and perform operations.
7. Find the intersection point of two linked lists.
8. Convert a binary search tree into a sorted doubly linked list.

**Super Advanced:**

1. Implement a skip list with multiple levels.
2. Convert a sorted doubly linked list back into a binary search tree.
3. Implement a self-adjusting linked list (move accessed items to the front).
4. Implement an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache using a linked list.
5. Solve problems related to linked lists on competitive coding platforms like LeetCode and HackerRank.
6. Research and implement more complex linked list variations like XOR linked lists.
